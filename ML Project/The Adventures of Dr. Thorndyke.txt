THE MECHANISM OF CRIME

A surprising amount of nonsense has been talked about conscience On the one hand remorse or the againbite as certain scholars of ultraTeutonic leanings would prefer to call it on the other hand an easy conscience these have been accepted as the determining factors of happiness or the reverse

Of course there is an element of truth in the easy conscience view but it begs the whole question A particularly hardy conscience may be quite easy under the most unfavourable conditionsconditions in which the more feeble conscience might be severely afflicted with the againbite And then it seems to be the fact that some fortunate persons have no conscience at all a negative gift that raises them above the mental vicissitudes of the common herd of humanity

Now Silas Hickler was a case in point No one looking into his cheerful round face beaming with benevolence and wreathed in perpetual smiles would have imagined him to be a criminal Least of all his worthy highchurch house keeper who was a witness to his unvarying amiability who constantly heard him carolling lightheartedly about the house and noted his appreciative zest at mealtimes

Yet it is a fact that Silas earned his modest though comfortable income by the gentle art of burglary A precarious trade and risky withal yet not so very hazardous if pursued with judgment and moderation And Silas was eminently a man of judgment He worked invariably alone He kept his own counsel No confederate had he to turn Kings Evidence at a pinch no one he knew would bounce off in a fit of temper to Scotland Yard Nor was he greedy and thriftless as most criminals are His scoops were few and far between carefully planned secretly executed and the proceeds judiciously invested in weekly property

In early life Silas had been connected with the diamond industry and he still did a little rather irregular dealing In the trade he was suspected of transactions with IDBs and one or two indiscreet dealers had gone so far as to whisper the ominous word fence But Silas Smiled a benevolent smile and went his way He knew what he knew and his clients in Amsterdam were not inquisitive

Such was Silas Hickler As he strolled round his garden in the dusk of an October evening he seemed the very type of modest middleclass prosperity He was dressed in the travelling suit that he wore on his little continental trips his bag was packed and stood in readiness on the sitting room sofa A parcel of diamonds purchased honestly though without impertinent questions at Southampton was in the inside pocket of his waistcoat and another more valuable parcel was stowed in a cavity in the heel of his right boot In an hour and a half it would be time for him to set out to catch the boat train at the junction meanwhile there was nothing to do but to stroll round the fading garden and consider how he should invest the proceeds of the impending deal His housekeeper had gone over to Welham for the weeks shopping and would probably not be back until eleven oclock He was alone in the premises and just a trifle dull

He was about to turn into the house when his ear caught the sound of footsteps on the unmade road that passed the end of the garden He paused and listened There was no other dwelling near and the road led nowhere fading away into the waste land beyond the house Could this be a visitor It seemed unlikely for visitors were few at Silas Hicklers house Meanwhile the footsteps continued to approach ringing out with increasing loudness on the hard stony path

Silas strolled down to the gate and leaning on it looked out with some curiosity Presently a glow of light showed him the face of a man apparently lighting his pipe then a dim figure detached itself from the enveloping gloom advanced towards him and halted opposite the garden The stranger removed a cigarette from his mouth and blowing out a cloud of smoke asked

Can you tell me if this road will take me to Badsham Junction

No replied Hickler but there is a footpath farther on that leads to the station

Footpath growled the stranger Ive had enough of footpaths I came down from town to Catley intending to walk across to the junction I started along the road and then some fool directed me to a short cut with the result that I have been blundering about in the dark for the last halfhour My sight isnt very good you know he added

What train do you want to catch asked Hickler

Seven fiftyeight was the reply

I am going to catch that train myself said Silas but I shant be starting for another hour The station is only threequarters of a mile from here If you like to come in and take a rest we can walk down together and then youll be sure of not missing your way

Its very good of you said the stranger peering with spectacled eyes at the dark house butI think

Might as well wait here as at the station said Silas in his genial way holding the gate open and the stranger after a momentary hesitation entered and flinging away his cigarette followed him to the door of the cottage

The sittingroom was in darkness save for the dull glow of the expiring fire but entering before his guest Silas applied a match to the lamp that hung from the ceiling As the flame leaped up flooding the little interior with light the two men regarded one another with mutual curiosity

Brodski by Jingo was Hicklers silent commentary as he looked at his guest Doesnt know me evidentlywouldnt of course after all these years and with his bad eyesight Take a seat sir he added aloud Will you join me in a little refreshment to while away the time

Brodski murmured an indistinct acceptance and as his host turned to open a cupboard he deposited his hat a hard grey felt on a chair in a corner placed his bag on the edge of the table resting his umbrella against it and sat down in a small armchair

Have a biscuit said Hickler as he placed a whiskybottle on the table together with a couple of his best starpattern tumblers and a siphon

Thanks I think I will said Brodski The railway journey and all this confounded tramping about you know

Yes agreed Silas Doesnt do to start with an empty stomach Hope you dont mind oatcakes I see theyre the only biscuits I have

Brodski hastened to assure him that oatcakes were his special and peculiar fancy and in confirmation having mixed himself a stiff jorum he fell to upon the biscuits with evident gusto

Brodski was a deliberate feeder and at present appeared to be somewhat sharp set His measured munching being unfavourable to conversation most of the talking fell to Silas and for once that genial transgressor found the task embarrassing The natural thing would have been to discuss his guests destination and perhaps the object of his journey but this was precisely what Hickler avoided doing For he knew both and instinct told him to keep his knowledge to himself

Brodski was a diamond merchant of considerable reputation and in a large way of business He bought stones principally in the rough and of these he was a most excellent judge His fancy was for stones of somewhat unusual size and value and it was well known to be his custom when he had accumulated a sufficient stock to carry them himself to Amsterdam and supervise the cutting of the rough stones Of this Hickler was aware and he had no doubt that Brodski was now starting on one of his periodical excursions that somewhere in the recesses of his rather shabby clothing was concealed a paper packet possibly worth several thousand pounds

Brodski sat by the table munching monotonously and talking little Hickler sat opposite him talking nervously and rather wildly at times and watching his guest with a growing fascination Precious stones and especially diamonds were Hicklers specialty Hard stuffsilver platehe avoided entirely gold excepting in the form of specie he seldom touched but stones of which he could carry off a whole consignment in the heel of his boot and dispose of with absolute safety formed the staple of his industry And here was a man sitting opposite him with a parcel in his pocket containing the equivalent of a dozen of his most successful scoops stones worth perhaps Here he pulled himself up short and began to talk rapidly though without much coherence For even as he talked other words formed subconsciously seemed to insinuate themselves into the interstices of the sentences and to carry on a parallel train of thought

Gets chilly in the evenings now doesnt it said Hickler

It does indeed Brodski agreed and then resumed his slow munching breathing audibly through his nose

Five thousand at least the subconscious train of thought resumed probably six or seven perhaps ten Silas fidgeted in his chair and endeavoured to concentrate his ideas on some topic of interest He was growing disagreeably conscious of a new and unfamiliar state of mind

Do you take any interest in gardening he asked Next to diamonds and weekly property his besetting weakness was fuchsias

Brodski chuckled sourly Hatton Garden is the nearest approach He broke off suddenly and then added I am a Londoner you know

The abrupt break in the sentence was not unnoticed by Silas nor had he any difficulty in interpreting it A man who carries untold wealth upon his person must needs be wary in his speech

Yes he answered absently its hardly a Londoners hobby And then half consciously he began a rapid calculation Put it at five thousand pounds What would that represent in weekly property His last set of houses had cost two hundred and fifty pounds apiece and he had let them at ten shillings and sixpence a week At that rate five thousand pounds represented twenty houses at ten and sixpence a weeksay ten pounds a weekone pound eight shillings a dayfive hundred and twenty pounds a yearfor life It was a competency Added to what he already had it was wealth With that income he could fling the tools of his trade into the river and live out the remainder of his life in comfort and security

He glanced furtively at his guest across the table and then looked away quickly as he felt stirring within him an impulse the nature of which he could not mistake This must be put an end to Crimes against the person he had always looked upon as sheer insanity There was it is true that little affair of the Weybridge policeman but that was unforeseen and unavoidable and it was the constables doing after all And there was the old housekeeper at Epsom too but of course if the old idiot would shriek in that insane fashionwell it was an accident very regrettable to be sure and no one could be more sorry for the mishap than himself But deliberate homiciderobbery from the person It was the act of a stark lunatic

Of course if he had happened to be that sort of person here was the opportunity of a lifetime The immense booty the empty house the solitary neighbourhood away from the main road and from other habitations the time the darknessbut of course there was the body to be thought of that was always the difficulty What to do with the body Here he caught the shriek of the up express rounding the curve in the line that ran past the waste land at the back of the house The sound started a new train of thought and as he followed it out his eyes fixed themselves on the unconscious and taciturn Brodski as he sat thoughtfully sipping his whisky At length averting his gaze with an effort he rose suddenly from his chair and turned to look at the clock on the mantelpiece spreading out his hands before the dying fire A tumult of strange sensations warned him to leave the house He shivered slightly though he was rather hot than chilly and turning his head looked at the door

Seems to be a confounded draught he said with another slight shiver did I shut the door properly I wonder He strode across the room and opening the door wide looked out into the dark garden A desire sudden and urgent had come over him to get out into the open air to be on the road and have done with this madness that was knocking at the door of his brain

I wonder if it is worth while to start yet he said with a yearning glance at the murky starless sky

Brodski roused himself and looked round Is your clock right he asked

Silas reluctantly admitted that it was

How long will it take us to walk to the station inquired Brodski

Oh about twentyfive minutes to halfanhour replied Silas unconsciously exaggerating the distance

Well said Brodski weve got more than an hour yet and its more comfortable here than hanging about the station I dont see the use of starting before we need

No of course not Silas agreed A wave of strange emotion halfregretful halftriumphant surged through his brain For some moments he remained standing on the threshold looking out dreamily into the night Then he softly closed the door and seemingly without the exercise of his volition the key turned noiselessly in the lock

He returned to his chair and tried to open a conversation with the taciturn Brodski but the words came faltering and disjointed He felt his face growing hot his brain full and intense and there was a faint highpitched singing in his ears He was conscious of watching his guest with a new and fearful interest and by sheer force of will turned away his eyes only to find them a moment later involuntarily returning to fix the unconscious man with yet more horrible intensity And ever through his mind walked like a dreadful procession the thoughts of what that other manthe man of blood and violencewould do in these circumstances Detail by detail the hideous synthesis fitted together the parts of the imagined crime and arranged them in due sequence until they formed a succession of events rational connected and coherent

He rose uneasily from his chair with his eyes still riveted upon his guest He could not sit any longer opposite that man with his hidden store of precious gems The impulse that he recognized with fear and wonder was growing more ungovernable from moment to moment If he stayed it would presently overpower him and then He shrank with horror from the dreadful thought but his fingers itched to handle the diamonds For Silas was after all a criminal by nature and habit He was a beast of prey His livelihood had never been earned it had been taken by stealth or if necessary by force His instincts were predacious and the proximity of unguarded valuables suggested to him as a logical consequence their abstraction or seizure His unwillingness to let these diamonds go away beyond his reach was fast becoming overwhelming

But he would make one more effort to escape He would keep out of Brodskis actual presence until the moment for starting came

If youll excuse me he said I will go and put on a thicker pair of boots After all this dry weather we may get a change and damp feet are very uncomfortable when you are travelling

Yes dangerous too agreed Brodski

Silas walked through into the adjoining kitchen where by the light of the little lamp that was burning there he had seen his stout country boots placed cleaned and in readiness and sat down upon a chair to make the change He did not of course intend to wear the country boots for the diamonds were concealed in those he had on But he would make the change and then alter his mind it would all help to pass the time He took a deep breath It was a relief at any rate to be out of that room Perhaps if he stayed away the temptation would pass Brodski would go on his wayhe wished that he was going aloneand the danger would be overat leastand the opportunity would have gonethe diamonds

He looked up as he slowly unlaced his boot From where he sat he could see Brodski sitting by the table with his back towards the kitchen door He had finished eating now and was composedly rolling a cigarette Silas breathed heavily and slipping off his boot sat for a while motionless gazing steadily at the other mans back Then he unlaced the other boot still staring abstractedly at his unconscious guest drew it off and laid it very quietly on the floor

Brodski calmly finished rolling his cigarette licked the paper put away his pouch and having dusted the crumbs of tobacco from his knees began to search his pockets for a match Suddenly yielding to an uncontrollable impulse Silas stood up and began stealthily to creep along the passage to the sittingroom Not a sound came from his stockinged feet Silently as a cat he stole forward breathing softly with parted lips until he stood at the threshold of the room His face flushed duskily his eyes wide and staring glittered in the lamplight and the racing blood hummed in his ears

Brodski struck a matchSilas noted that it was a wooden vestalighted his cigarette blew out the match and flung it into the fender Then he replaced the box in his pocket and commenced to smoke

Slowly and without a sound Silas crept forward into the room step by step with catlike stealthiness until he stood close behind Brodskis chairso close that he had to turn his head that his breath might not stir the hair upon the other mans head So for halfaminute he stood motionless like a symbolical statue of Murder glaring down with horrible glittering eyes upon the unconscious diamond merchant while his quick breath passed without a sound through his open mouth and his fingers writhed slowly like the tentacles of a giant hydra And then as noiselessly as ever he backed away to the door turned quickly and walked back into the kitchen

He drew a deep breath It had been a near thing Brodskis life had hung upon a thread For it had been so easy Indeed if he had happened as he stood behind the mans chair to have a weapona hammer for instance or even a stone

He glanced round the kitchen and his eyes lighted on a bar that had been left by the workmen who had put up the new greenhouse It was an odd piece cut off from a square wroughtiron stanchion and was about a foot long and perhaps threequarters of an inch thick Now if he had had that in his hand a minute ago

He picked the bar up balanced it in his hand and swung it round his head A formidable weapon this silent too And it fitted the plan that had passed through his brain Bah He had better put the thing down

But he did not He stepped over to the door and looked again at Brodski sitting as before meditatively smoking with his back towards the kitchen

Suddenly a change came over Silas His face flushed the veins of his neck stood out and a sullen scowl settled on his face He drew out his watch glanced at it earnestly and replaced it Then he strode swiftly but silently along the passage into the sittingroom

A pace away from his victims chair he halted and took deliberate aim The bar swung aloft but not without some faint rustle of movement for Brodski looked round quickly even as the iron whistled through the air The movement disturbed the murderers aim and the bar glanced off his victims head making only a trifling wound Brodski sprang up with a tremulous bleating cry and clutched his assailants arms with the tenacity of mortal terror

Then began a terrible struggle as the two men locked in a deadly embrace swayed to and fro and trampled backwards and forwards The chair was overturned an empty glass swept from the table and with Brodskis spectacles crushed beneath stamping feet And thrice that dreadful pitiful bleating cry rang out into the night filling Silas despite his murderous frenzy with terror lest some chance wayfarer should hear it Gathering his great strength for a final effort he forced his victim backwards onto the table and snatching up a corner of the tablecloth thrust it into his face and crammed it into his mouth as it opened to utter another shriek And thus they remained for a full two minutes almost motionless like some dreadful group of tragic allegory Then when the last faint twitchings had died away Silas relaxed his grasp and let the limp body slip softly onto the floor

It was over For good or for evil the thing was done Silas stood up breathing heavily and as he wiped the sweat from his face he looked at the clock The hands stood at one minute to seven The whole thing had taken a little over three minutes He had nearly an hour in which to finish his task The goods train that entered into his scheme came by at twenty minutes past and it was only three hundred yards to the line Still he must not waste time He was now quite composed and only disturbed by the thought that Brodskis cries might have been heard If no one had heard them it was all plain sailing

He stooped and gently disengaging the tablecloth from the dead mans teeth began a careful search of his pockets He was not long finding what he sought and as he pinched the paper packet and felt the little hard bodies grating on one another inside his faint regrets for what had happened were swallowed up in selfcongratulations

He now set about his task with businesslike briskness and an attentive eye on the clock A few large drops of blood had fallen on the tablecloth and there was a small bloody smear on the carpet by the dead mans head Silas fetched from the kitchen some water a nailbrush and a dry cloth and having washed out the stains from the tablecovernot forgetting the deal tabletop underneathand cleaned away the smear from the carpet and rubbed the damp places dry he slipped a sheet of paper under the head of the corpse to prevent further contamination Then he set the table cloth straight stood the chair upright laid the broken spectacles on the table and picked up the cigarette which had been trodden flat in the struggle and flung it under the grate Then there was the broken glass which he swept up into a dustpan Part of it was the remains of the shattered tumbler and the rest the fragments of the broken spectacles He turned it out onto a sheet of paper and looked it over carefully picking out the larger recognizable pieces of the spectacleglasses and putting them aside on a separate slip of paper together with a sprinkling of the minute fragments The remainder he shot back into the dustpan and having hurriedly put on his boots carried it out to the rubbishheap at the back of the house

It was now time to start Hastily cutting off a length of string from his stringboxfor Silas was an orderly man and despised the oddments of string with which many people make shifthe tied it to the dead mans bag and umbrella and slung them from his shoulder Then he folded up the paper of broken glass and slipping it and the spectacles into his pocket picked up the body and threw it over his shoulder Brodski was a small spare man weighing not more than nine stone not a very formidable burden for a big athletic man like Silas

The night was intensely dark and when Silas looked out of the back gate over the waste land that stretched from his house to the railway he could hardly see twenty yards ahead After listening cautiously and hearing no sound he went out shut the gate softly behind him and set forth at a good pace though carefully over the broken ground His progress was not as silent as he could have wished for though the scanty turf that covered the gravelly land was thick enough to deaden his footfalls the swinging bag and umbrella made an irritating noise indeed his movements were more hampered by them than by the weightier burden

The distance to the line was about three hundred yards Ordinarily he would have walked it in from three to four minutes but now going cautiously with his burden and stopping now and again to listen it took him just six minutes to reach the threebar fence that separated the waste land from the railway Arrived here he halted for a moment and once more listened attentively peering into the darkness on all sides Not a living creature was to be seen or heard in this desolate spot but far away the shriek of an engines whistle warned him to hasten

Lifting the corpse easily over the fence he carried it a few yards farther to a point where the line curved sharply Here he laid it face downwards with the neck over the near rail Drawing out his pocketknife he cut through the knot that fastened the umbrella to the string and also secured the bag and when he had flung the bag and umbrella on the track beside the body he carefully pocketed the string excepting the little loop that had fallen to the ground when the knot was cut

The quick snort and clanking rumble of an approaching goods train began now to be clearly audible Rapidly Silas drew from his pockets the battered spectacles and the packet of broken glass The former he threw down by the dead mans head and then emptying the packet into his hand sprinkled the fragments of glass around the spectacles

He was none too soon Already the quick laboured puffing of the engine sounded close at hand His impulse was to stay and watch to witness the final catastrophe that should convert the murder into an accident or suicide But it was hardly safe it would be better that he should not be near lest he should not be able to get away without being seen Hastily he climbed back over the fence and strode away across the rough fields while the train came snorting and clattering towards the curve

He had nearly reached his back gate when a sound from the line brought him to a sudden halt it was a prolonged whistle accompanied by the groan of brakes and the loud clank of colliding trucks The snorting of the engine had ceased and was replaced by the penetrating hiss of escaping steam

The train had stopped

For one brief moment Silas stood with bated breath and mouth agape like one petrified then he strode forward quickly to the gate and letting himself in silently slid the bolt He was undeniably alarmed What could have happened on the line It was practically certain that the body had been seen but what was happening now and would they come to the house He entered the kitchen and having paused again to listenfor somebody might come and knock at the door at any momenthe walked through the sittingroom and looked round All seemed in order there There was the bar though lying where he had dropped it in the scuffle He picked it up and held it under the lamp There was no blood on it only one or two hairs Somewhat absently he wiped it with the tablecover and then running out through the kitchen into the back garden dropped it over the wall into a bed of nettles Not that there was any thing incriminating in the bar but since he had used it as a weapon it had somehow acquired a sinister aspect to his eye

He now felt that it would be well to start for the station at once It was not time yet for it was barely twentyfive minutes past seven but he did not wish to be found in the house if any one should come His soft hat was on the sofa with his bag to which his umbrella was strapped He put on the hat caught up the bag and stepped over to the door then he came back to turn down the lamp And it was at this moment when he stood with his hand raised to the burner that his eyes travelling by chance into the dim corner of the room lighted on Brodskis grey felt hat reposing on the chair where the dead man had placed it when he entered the house

Silas stood for a few moments as if petrified with the chilly sweat of mortal fear standing in beads upon his forehead Another instant and he would have turned the lamp down and gone on his way and then he strode over to the chair snatched up the hat and looked inside it Yes there was the name Oscar Brodski written plainly on the lining If he had gone away leaving it to be discovered he would have been lost indeed even now if a searchparty should come to the house it was enough to send him to the gallows

His limbs shook with horror at the thought but in spite of his panic he did not lose his selfpossession Darting through into the kitchen he grabbed up a handful of the dry brushwood that was kept for lighting fires and carried it to the sittingroom grate where he thrust it on the extinct but still hot embers and crumpling up the paper that he had placed under Brodskis headon which paper he now noticed for the first time a minute bloody smearhe poked it in under the wood and striking a wax match set light to it As the wood flared up he hacked at the hat with his pocket knife and threw the ragged strips into the blaze

And all the while his heart was thumping and his hands atremble with the dread of discovery The fragments of felt were far from inflammable tending rather to fuse into cindery masses that smoked and smouldered than to burn away into actual ash Moreover to his dismay they emitted a powerful resinous stench mixed with the odour of burning hair so that he had to open the kitchen window since he dared not unlock the front door to disperse the reek And still as he fed the fire with small cut fragments he strained his ears to catch above the crackling of the wood the sound of the dreaded footsteps the knock on the door that should be as the summons of Fate

The time too was speeding on Twentyone minutes to eight In a few minutes more he must set out or he would miss the train He dropped the dismembered hatbrim on the blazing wood and ran upstairs to open a window since he must close that in the kitchen before he left When he came back the brim had already curled up into a black clinkery mass that bubbled and hissed as the fat pungent smoke rose from it sluggishly to the chimney

Nineteen minutes to eight It was time to start He took up the poker and carefully beat the cinders into small particles stirring them into the glowing embers of the wood and coal There was nothing unusual in the appearance of the grate It was his constant custom to burn letters and other discarded articles in the sitting room fire his housekeeper would notice nothing out of the common Indeed the cinders would probably be reduced to ashes before she returned He had been careful to notice that there were no metallic fittings of any kind in the hat which might have escaped burning

Once more he picked up his bag took a last look round turned down the lamp and unlocking the door held it open for a few moments Then he went out locked the door pocketed the key of which his housekeeper had a duplicate and set off at a brisk pace for the station

He arrived in good time after all and having taken his ticket strolled through onto the platform The train was not yet signalled but there seemed to be an unusual stir in the place The passengers were collected in a group at one end of the platform and were all looking in one direction down the line and even as he walked towards them with a certain tremulous nauseating curiosity two men emerged from the darkness and ascended the slope to the platform carrying a stretcher covered with a tarpaulin The passengers parted to let the bearers pass turning fascinated eyes upon the shape that showed faintly through the rough pall and when the stretcher had been borne into the lamproom they fixed their attention upon a porter who followed carrying a handbag and an umbrella

Suddenly one of the passengers started forward with an exclamation

Is that his umbrella he demanded

Yes sir answered the porter stopping and holding it out for the speakers inspection

My God ejaculated the passenger then turning sharply to a tall man who stood close by he said excitedly Thats Brodskis umbrella I could swear to it You remember Brodski The tall man nodded and the passenger turning once more to the porter said I identify that umbrella It belongs to a gentleman named Brodski If you look in his hat you will see his name written in it He always writes his name in his hat

We havent found his hat yet said the porter but here is the stationmaster coming up the line He awaited the arrival of his superior and then announced This gentleman sir has identified the umbrella

Oh said the stationmaster you recognize the umbrella sir do you Then perhaps you would step into the lamproom and see if you can identify the body

Is itis hevery much injured the passenger asked tremulously

Well yes was the reply You see the engine and six of the trucks went over him before they could stop the train Took his head clean off in fact

Shocking shocking gasped the passenger I think if you dont mindIdId rather not You dont think its necessary doctor do you

Yes I do replied the tall man Early identification may be of the first importance

Then I suppose I must said the passenger

Very reluctantly he allowed himself to be conducted by the stationmaster to the lamproom as the clang of the bell announced the approaching train Silas Hickler followed and took his stand with the expectant crowd outside the closed door In a few moments the passenger burst out pale and awestricken and rushed up to his tall friend It is he exclaimed breathlessly Its Brodski Poor old Brodski Horrible horrible He was to have met me here and come on with me to Amsterdam

Had he anymerchandize about him the tall man asked and Silas strained his ears to catch the reply

He had some stones no doubt but I dont know what His clerk will know of course By the way doctor could you watch the case for me Just to be sure it was really an accident oryou know what We were old friends you know fellow townsmen too we were both born in Warsaw Id like you to give an eye to the case

Very well said the other I will satisfy myself thatthere is nothing more than appears and let you have a report Will that do

Thank you Its excessively good of you doctor Ah here comes the train I hope it wont inconvenience you to stay and see to this matter

Not in the least replied the doctor We are not due at Warmington until tomorrow afternoon and I expect we can find out all that is necessary to know before that

Silas looked long and curiously at the tall imposing man who was as it were taking his seat at the chess board to play against him for his life A formidable antagonist he looked with his keen thoughtful face so resolute and calm As Silas stepped into his carriage he thought with deep discomfort of Brodskis hat and hoped that he had made no other oversight





PART II



THE MECHANISM OF DETECTION

Related by Christopher Jervis MD

The singular circumstances that attended the death of Mr Oscar Brodski the wellknown diamond merchant of Hatton Garden illustrated very forcibly the importance of one or two points in medicolegal practice which Thorndyke was accustomed to insist were not sufficiently appreciated What those points were I shall leave my friend and teacher to state at the proper place and meanwhile as the case is in the highest degree instructive I shall record the incidents in the order of their occurrence

The dusk of an October evening was closing in as Thorndyke and I the sole occupants of a smoking compartment found ourselves approaching the little station of Ludham and as the train slowed down we peered out at the knot of country people who were waiting on the platform Suddenly Thorndyke exclaimed in a tone of surprise Why that is surely Boscovitch and almost at the same moment a brisk excitable little man darted at the door of our compartment and literally tumbled in

I hope I dont intrude on this learned conclave he said shaking hands genially and banging his Gladstone with impulsive violence into the rack but I saw your faces at the window and naturally jumped at the chance of such pleasant companionship

You are very flattering said Thorndyke so flattering that you leave us nothing to say But what in the name of fortune are you doing atwhats the name of the placeLudham

My brother has a little place a mile or so from here and I have been spending a couple of days with him Mr Boscovitch explained I shall change at Badsham Junction and catch the boat train for Amsterdam But whither are you two bound I see you have your mysterious little green box up on the hatrack so I infer that you are on some romantic quest eh Going to unravel some dark and intricate crime

No replied Thorndyke We are bound for Warmington on a quite prosaic errand I am instructed to watch the proceedings at an inquest there tomorrow on behalf of the Griffin Life Insurance Office and we are travelling down tonight as it is rather a crosscountry journey

But why the box of magic asked Boscovitch glancing up at the hatrack

I never go away from home without it answered Thorndyke One never knows what may turn up the trouble of carrying it is small when set off against the comfort of having appliances at hand in an emergency

Boscovitch continued to stare up at the little square case covered with Willesden canvas Presently he remarked I often used to wonder what you had in it when you were down at Chelmsford in connection with that bank murderwhat an amazing case that was by the way and didnt your methods of research astonish the police As he still looked up wistfully at the case Thorndyke goodnaturedly lifted it down and unlocked it As a matter of fact he was rather proud of his portable laboratory and certainly it was a triumph of condensation for small as it wasonly a foot square by four inches deepit contained a fairly complete outfit for a preliminary investigation

Wonderful exclaimed Boscovitch when the case lay open before him displaying its rows of little reagent bottles tiny testtubes diminutive spiritlamp dwarf microscope and assorted instruments on the same Lilliputian scale its like a dolls houseeverything looks as if it was seen through the wrong end of a telescope But are these tiny things really efficient That microscope now

Perfectly efficient at low and moderate magnifications said Thorndyke It looks like a toy but it isnt one the lenses are the best that can be had Of course a fullsized instrument would be infinitely more convenientbut I shouldnt have it with me and should have to make shift with a pocketlens And so with the rest of the undersized appliances they are the alternative to no appliances

Boscovitch pored over the case and its contents fingering the instruments delicately and asking questions innumerable about their uses indeed his curiosity was but half appeased when halfanhour later the train began to slow down

By Jove he exclaimed starting up and seizing his bag here we are at the junction already You change here too dont you

Yes replied Thorndyke We take the branch train on to Warmington

As we stepped out onto the platform we became aware that something unusual was happening or had happened All the passengers and most of the porters and supernumeraries were gathered at one end of the station and all were looking intently into the darkness down the line

Anything wrong asked Mr Boscovitch addressing the stationinspector

Yes sir the official replied a man has been run over by the goods train about a mile down the line The station master has gone down with a stretcher to bring him in and I expect that is his lantern that you see coming this way

As we stood watching the dancing light grow momentarily brighter flashing fitful reflections from the burnished rails a man came out of the bookingoffice and joined the group of onlookers He attracted my attention as I afterwards remembered for two reasons in the first place his round jolly face was excessively pale and bore a strained and wild expression and in the second though he stared into the darkness with eager curiosity he asked no questions

The swinging lantern continued to approach and then suddenly two men came into sight bearing a stretcher covered with a tarpaulin through which the shape of a human figure was dimly discernible They ascended the slope to the platform and proceeded with their burden to the lamproom when the inquisitive gaze of the passengers was transferred to a porter who followed carrying a handbag and umbrella and to the stationmaster who brought up the rear with his lantern

As the porter passed Mr Boscovitch started forward with sudden excitement

Is that his umbrella he asked

Yes sir answered the porter stopping and holding it out for the speakers inspection

My God ejaculated Boscovitch then turning sharply to Thorndyke he exclaimed Thats Brodskis umbrella I could swear to it You remember Brodski

Thorndyke nodded and Boscovitch turning once more to the porter said I identify that umbrella It belongs to a gentleman named Brodski If you look in his hat you will see his name written in it He always writes his name in his hat

We havent found his hat yet said the porter but here is the stationmaster He turned to his superior and announced This gentleman sir has identified the umbrella

Oh said the stationmaster you recognize the umbrella sir do you Then perhaps you would step into the lamproom and see if you can identify the body

Mr Boscovitch recoiled with a look of alarm Is itis hevery much injured he asked nervously

Well yes was the reply You see the engine and six of the trucks went over him before they could stop the train Took his head clean off in fact

Shocking shocking gasped Boscovitch I thinkif you dont mindIdId rather not You dont think it necessary doctor do you

Yes I do replied Thorndyke Early identification may be of the first importance

Then I suppose I must said Boscovitch and with extreme reluctance he followed the stationmaster to the lamproom as the loud ringing of the bell announced the approach of the boat train His inspection must have been of the briefest for in a few moments he burst out pale and awestricken and rushed up to Thorndyke

It is he exclaimed breathlessly Its Brodski Poor old Brodski Horrible horrible He was to have met me here and come on with me to Amsterdam

Had he anymerchandize about him Thorndyke asked and as he spoke the stranger whom I had previously noticed edged up closer as if to catch the reply

He had some stones no doubt answered Boscovitch but I dont know what they were His clerk will know of course By the way doctor could you watch the case for me Just to be sure it was really an accident oryou know what We were old friends you know fellow townsmen too we were both born in Warsaw Id like you to give an eye to the case

Very well said Thorndyke I will satisfy myself that there is nothing more than appears and let you have a report Will that do

Thank you said Boscovitch Its excessively good of you doctor Ah here comes the train I hope it wont inconvenience you to stay and see to the matter

Not in the least replied Thorndyke We are not due at Warmington until tomorrow afternoon and I expect we can find out all that is necessary to know and still keep our appointment

As Thorndyke spoke the stranger who had kept close to us with the evident purpose of hearing what was said bestowed on him a very curious and attentive look and it was only when the train had actually come to rest by the platform that he hurried away to find a compartment

No sooner had the train left the station than Thorndyke sought out the stationmaster and informed him of the instructions that he had received from Boscovitch Of course he added in conclusion we must not move in the matter until the police arrive I suppose they have been informed

Yes replied the stationmaster I sent a message at once to the Chief Constable and I expect him or an inspector at any moment In fact I think I will slip out to the approach and see if he is coming He evidently wished to have a word in private with the police officer before committing himself to any statement

As the official departed Thorndyke and I began to pace the now empty platform and my friend as was his wont when entering on a new inquiry meditatively reviewed the features of the problem

In a case of this kind he remarked we have to decide on one of three possible explanations accident suicide or homicide and our decision will be determined by inferences from three sets of facts first the general facts of the case second the special data obtained by examination of the body and third the special data obtained by examining the spot on which the body was found Now the only general facts at present in our possession are that the deceased was a diamond merchant making a journey for a specific purpose and probably having on his person property of small bulk and great value These facts are somewhat against the hypothesis of suicide and somewhat favourable to that of homicide Facts relevant to the question of accident would be the existence or otherwise of a level crossing a road or path leading to the line an enclosing fence with or without a gate and any other facts rendering probable or otherwise the accidental presence of the deceased at the spot where the body was found As we do not possess these facts it is desirable that we extend our knowledge

Why not put a few discreet questions to the porter who brought in the bag and umbrella I suggested He is at this moment in earnest conversation with the ticket collector and would no doubt be glad of a new listener

An excellent suggestion Jervis answered Thorndyke Let us see what he has to tell us We approached the porter and found him as I had anticipated bursting to unburden himself of the tragic story

The way the thing happened sir was this he said in answer to Thorndykes question Theres a sharpish bend in the road just at that place and the goods train was just rounding the curve when the driver suddenly caught sight of something lying across the rails As the engine turned the headlights shone on it and then he saw it was a man He shut off steam at once blew his whistle and put the brakes down hard but as you know sir a goods train takes some stopping before they could bring her up the engine and halfadozen trucks had gone over the poor beggar

Could the driver see how the man was lying Thorndyke asked

Yes he could see him quite plain because the head lights were full on him He was lying on his face with his neck over the near rail on the down side His head was in the fourfoot and his body by the side of the track It looked as if he had laid himself out apurpose

Is there a level crossing thereabouts asked Thorndyke

No sir No crossing no road no path no nothing said the porter ruthlessly sacrificing grammar to emphasis He must have come across the fields and climbed over the fence to get onto the permanent way Deliberate suicide is what it looks like

How did you learn all this Thorndyke inquired

Why the driver you see sir when him and his mate had lifted the body off the track went on to the next signal box and sent in his report by telegram The stationmaster told me all about it as we walked down the line

Thorndyke thanked the man for his information and as we strolled back towards the lamproom discussed the bearing of these new facts

Our friend is unquestionably right in one respect he said this was not an accident The man might if he were nearsighted deaf or stupid have climbed over the fence and got knocked down by the train But his position lying across the rails can only be explained by one of two hypotheses either it was as the porter says deliberate suicide or else the man was already dead or insensible We must leave it at that until we have seen the body that is if the police will allow us to see it But here comes the stationmaster and an officer with him Let us hear what they have to say

The two officials had evidently made up their minds to decline any outside assistance The divisional surgeon would make the necessary examination and information could be obtained through the usual channels The production of Thorndykes card however somewhat altered the situation The police inspector hummed and hawed irresolutely with the card in his hand but finally agreed to allow us to view the body and we entered the lamproom together the stationmaster leading the way to turn up the gas

The stretcher stood on the floor by one wall its grim burden still hidden by the tarpaulin and the handbag and umbrella lay on a large box together with the battered frame of a pair of spectacles from which the glasses had fallen out

Were these spectacles found by the body Thorndyke inquired

Yes replied the stationmaster They were close to the head and the glass was scattered about on the ballast

Thorndyke made a note in his pocketbook and then as he inspector removed the tarpaulin he glanced down on the corpse lying limply on the stretcher and looking grotesquely horrible with its displaced head and distorted limbs For fully a minute he remained silently stooping over the uncanny object on which the inspector was now throwing the light of a large lantern then he stood up and said quietly to me I think we can eliminate two out of the three hypotheses

The inspector looked at him quickly and was about to ask a question when his attention was diverted by the travellingcase which Thorndyke had laid on a shelf and now opened to abstract a couple of pairs of dissecting forceps

Weve no authority to make a post mortem you know said the inspector

No of course not said Thorndyke I am merely going to look into the mouth With one pair of forceps he turned back the lip and having scrutinized its inner surface closely examined the teeth

May I trouble you for your lens Jervis he said and as I handed him my doublet ready opened the inspector brought the lantern close to the dead face and leaned forward eagerly In his usual systematic fashion Thorndyke slowly passed the lens along the whole range of sharp uneven teeth and then bringing it back to the centre examined with more minuteness the upper incisors At length very delicately he picked out with his forceps some minute object from between two of the upper front teeth and held it in the focus of the lens Anticipating his next move I took a labelled microscopeslide from the case and handed it to him together with a dissecting needle and as he transferred the object to the slide and spread it out with the needle I set up the little microscope on the shelf

A drop of Farrant and a coverglass please Jervis said Thorndyke

I handed him the bottle and when he had let a drop of the mounting fluid fall gently on the object and put on the coverslip he placed the slide on the stage of the microscope and examined it attentively

Happening to glance at the inspector I observed on his countenance a faint grin which he politely strove to suppress when he caught my eye

I was thinking sir he said apologetically that its a bit off the track to be finding out what he had for dinner He didnt die of unwholesome feeding

Thorndyke looked up with a smile It doesnt do inspector to assume that anything is off the track in an inquiry of this kind Every fact must have some significance you know

I dont see any significance in the diet of a man who has had his head cut off the inspector rejoined defiantly

Dont you said Thorndyke Is there no interest attaching to the last meal of a man who has met a violent death These crumbs for instance that are scattered over the dead mans waistcoat Can we learn nothing from them

I dont see what you can learn was the dogged rejoinder

Thorndyke picked off the crumbs one by one with his forceps and having deposited them on a slide inspected them first with the lens and then through the microscope

I learn said he that shortly before his death the deceased partook of some kind of wholemeal biscuits apparently composed partly of oatmeal

I call that nothing said the inspector The question that we have got to settle is not what refreshments had the deceased been taking but what was the cause of his death did he commit suicide was he killed by accident or was there any foul play

I beg your pardon said Thorndyke the questions that remain to be settled are who killed the deceased and with what motive The others are already answered as far as I am concerned

The inspector stared in sheer amazement not unmixed with incredulity

You havent been long coming to a conclusion sir he said

No it was a pretty obvious case of murder said Thorndyke As to the motive the deceased was a diamond merchant and is believed to have had a quantity of stones about his person I should suggest that you search the body

The inspector gave vent to an exclamation of disgust I see he said It was just a guess on your part The dead man was a diamond merchant and had valuable property about him therefore he was murdered He drew himself up and regarding Thorndyke with stern reproach added But you must understand sir that this is a judicial inquiry not a prize competition in a penny paper And as to searching the body why that is what I principally came for He ostentatiously turned his back on us and proceeded systematically to turn out the dead mans pockets laying the articles as he removed them on the box by the side of the handbag and umbrella

While he was thus occupied Thorndyke looked over the body generally paying special attention to the soles of the boots which to the inspectors undissembled amusement he very thoroughly examined with the lens

I should have thought sir that his feet were large enough to be seen with the naked eye was his comment but perhaps he added with a sly glance at the station master youre a little nearsighted

Thorndyke chuckled goodhumouredly and while the officer continued his search he looked over the articles that had already been laid on the box The purse and pocket book he naturally left for the inspector to open but the readingglasses pocketknife and cardcase and other small pocket articles were subjected to a searching scrutiny The inspector watched him out of the corner of his eye with furtive amusement saw him hold up the glasses to the light to estimate their refractive power peer into the tobacco pouch open the cigarette book and examine the watermark of the paper and even inspect the contents of the silver matchbox

What might you have expected to find in his tobacco pouch the officer asked laying down a bunch of keys from the dead mans pocket

Tobacco Thorndyke replied stolidly but I did not expect to find finecut Latakia I dont remember ever having seen pure Latakia smoked in cigarettes

You do take an interest in things sir said the inspector with a side glance at the stolid stationmaster

I do Thorndyke agreed and I note that there are no diamonds among this collection

No and we dont know that he had any about him but theres a gold watch and chain a diamond scarfpin and a purse containinghe opened it and tipped out its contents into his handtwelve pounds in gold That doesnt look much like robbery does it What do you say to the murder theory now

My opinion is unchanged said Thorndyke and I should like to examine the spot where the body was found Has the engine been inspected he added addressing the stationmaster

I telegraphed to Bradfield to have it examined the official answered The report has probably come in by now Id better see before we start down the line

We emerged from the lamproom and at the door found the stationinspector waiting with a telegram He handed it to the stationmaster who read it aloud

The engine has been carefully examined by me I find small smear of blood on near leading wheel and smaller one on next wheel following No other marks He glanced questioningly at Thorndyke who nodded and remarked It will be interesting to see if the line tells the same tale

The stationmaster looked puzzled and was apparently about to ask for an explanation but the inspector who had carefully pocketed the dead mans property was impatient to start and accordingly when Thorndyke had repacked his case and had at his own request been furnished with a lantern we set off down the permanent way Thorndyke carrying the light and I the indispensable green case

I am a little in the dark about this affair I said when we had allowed the two officials to draw ahead out of ear shot you came to a conclusion remarkably quickly What was it that so immediately determined the opinion of murder as against suicide

It was a small matter but very conclusive replied Thorndyke You noticed a small scalpwound above the left temple It was a glancing wound and might easily have been made by the engine Butthe wound had bled and it had bled for an appreciable time There were two streams of blood from it and in both the blood was firmly clotted and partially dried But the man had been decapitated and this wound if inflicted by the engine must have been made after the decapitation since it was on the side most distant from the engine as it approached Now a decapitated head does not bleed Therefore this wound was inflicted before the decapitation

But not only had the wound bled the blood had trickled down in two streams at right angles to one another First in the order of time as shown by the appearance of the stream it had trickled down the side of the face and dropped on the collar The second stream ran from the wound to the back of the head Now you know Jervis there are no exceptions to the law of gravity If the blood ran down the face towards the chin the face must have been upright at the time and if the blood trickled from the front to the back of the head the head must have been horizontal and face upwards But the man when he was seen by the engine driver was lying face downwards The only possible inference is that when the wound was inflicted the man was in the upright positionstanding or sitting and that subsequently and while he was still alive he lay on his back for a sufficiently long time for the blood to have trickled to the back of his head

I see I was a duffer not to have reasoned this out for myself I remarked contritely

Quick observation and rapid inference come by practice replied Thorndyke What did you notice about the face

I thought there was a strong suggestion of asphyxia

Undoubtedly said Thorndyke It was the face of a suffocated man You must have noticed too that the tongue was very distinctly swollen and that on the inside of the upper lip were deep indentations made by the teeth as well as one or two slight wounds obviously caused by heavy pressure on the mouth And now observe how completely these facts and inferences agree with those from the scalp wound If we knew that the deceased had received a blow on the head had struggled with his assailant and been finally borne down and suffocated we should look for precisely those signs which we have found

By the way what was it that you found wedged between the teeth I did not get a chance to look through the microscope

Ah said Thorndyke there we not only get confirmation but we carry our inferences a stage further The object was a little tuft of some textile fabric Under the microscope I found it to consist of several different fibres differently dyed The bulk of it consisted of wool fibres dyed crimson but there were also cotton fibres dyed blue and a few which looked like jute dyed yellow It was obviously a particoloured fabric and might have been part of a womans dress though the presence of the jute is much more suggestive of a curtain or rug of inferior quality

And its importance

Is that if it is not part of an article of clothing then it must have come from an article of furniture and furniture suggests a habitation

That doesnt seem very conclusive I objected

It is not but it is valuable corroboration





Of what

Of the suggestion offered by the soles of the dead mans boots I examined them most minutely and could find no trace of sand gravel or earth in spite of the fact that he must have crossed fields and rough land to reach the place where he was found What I did find was fine tobacco ash a charred mark as if a cigar or cigarette had been trodden on Several crumbs of biscuit and on a projecting brad some coloured fibres apparently from a carpet The manifest suggestion is that the man was killed in a house with a carpeted floor and carried from thence to the railway

I was silent for Some moments Well as I knew Thorndyke I was completely taken by surprise a sensation indeed that I experienced anew every time that I accompanied him on one of his investigations His marvellous power of coordinating apparently insignificant facts of arranging them into an ordered sequence and making them tell a coherent story was a phenomenon that I never got used to every exhibition of it astonished me afresh

If your inferences are correct I said the problem is practically solved There must be abundant traces inside the house The only question is which house is it

Quite so replied Thorndyke that is the question and a very difficult question it is A glance at that interior would doubtless clear up the whole mystery But how are we to get that glance We cannot enter houses speculatively to see if they present traces of a murder At present our clue breaks off abruptly The other end of it is in some unknown house and if we cannot join up the two ends our problem remains unsolved For the question is you remember Who killed Oscar Brodski

Then what do you propose to do I asked

The next stage of the inquiry is to connect some particular house with this crime To that end I can only gather up all available facts and consider each in all its possible bearings If I cannot establish any such connection then the inquiry will have failed and we shall have to make a fresh startsay at Amsterdam if it turns out that Brodski really had diamonds on his person as I have no doubt he had Here our conversation was interrupted by our arrival at the spot where the body had been found The stationmaster had halted and he and the inspector were now examining the near rail by the light of their lanterns

Theres remarkably little blood about said the former Ive seen a good many accidents of this kind and there has always been a lot of blood both on the engine and on the road Its very curious

Thorndyke glanced at the rail with but slight attention that question had ceased to interest him But the light of his lantern flashed onto the ground at the side of the tracka loose gravelly soil mixed with fragments of chalkand from thence to the soles of the inspectors boots which were displayed as he knelt by the rail

You observe Jervis he said in a low voice and I nodded The inspectors bootsoles were covered with adherent particles of gravel and conspicuously marked by the chalk on which he had trodden

You havent found the hat I suppose Thorndyke asked stooping to pick up a short piece of string that lay on the ground at the side of the track

No replied the inspector but it cant be far off You seem to have found another clue sir he added with a grin glancing at the piece of string

Who knows said Thorndyke A short end of white twine with a green strand in it It may tell us something later At any rate well keep it and taking from his pocket a small tin box containing among other things a number of seed envelopes he slipped the string into one of the latter and scribbled a note in pencil on the outside The inspector watched his proceedings with an indulgent smile and then returned to his examination of the track in which Thorndyke now joined

I suppose the poor chap was nearsighted the officer remarked indicating the remains of the shattered spectacles that might account for his having strayed onto the line

Possibly said Thorndyke He had already noticed the fragments scattered over a sleeper and the adjacent ballast and now once more produced his collectingbox from which he took another seed envelope Would you hand me a pair of forceps Jervis he said and perhaps you wouldnt mind taking a pair yourself and helping me to gather up these fragments

As I complied the inspector looked up curiously

There isnt any doubt that these spectacles belonged to the deceased is there he asked He certainly wore spectacles for I saw the mark on his nose

Still there is no harm in verifying the fact said Thorndyke and he added to me in a lower tone Pick up every particle you can find Jervis It may be most important

I dont quite see how I said groping amongst the shingle by the light of the lantern in search of the tiny splinters of glass

Dont you returned Thorndyke Well look at these fragments some of them are a fair size but many of these on the sleeper are mere grains And consider their number Obviously the condition of the glass does not agree with the circumstances in which we find it These are thick con cave spectaclelenses broken into a great number of minute fragments Now how were they broken Not merely by falling evidently such a lens when it is dropped breaks into a small number of large pieces Nor were they broken by the wheel passing over them for they would then have been reduced to fine powder and that powder would have been visible on the rail which it is not The spectacle frames you may remember presented the same incongruity they were battered and damaged more than they would have been by falling but not nearly so much as they would have been if the wheel had passed over them

What do you suggest then I asked

The appearances suggest that the spectacles had been trodden on But if the body was carried here the probability is that the spectacles were carried here too and that they were then already broken for it is more likely that they were trodden on during the struggle than that the murderer trod on them after bringing them here Hence the importance of picking up every fragment

But why I inquired rather foolishly I must admit

Because if when we have picked up every fragment that we can find there still remains missing a larger portion of the lenses than we could reasonably expect that would tend to support our hypothesis and we might find the missing remainder elsewhere If on the other hand we find as much of the lenses as we could expect to find we must conclude that they were broken on this spot

While we were conducting our search the two officials were circling around with their lanterns in quest of the missing hat and when we had at length picked up the last fragment and a careful search even aided by a lens failed to reveal any other we could see their lanterns moving like willothewisps some distance down the line

We may as well see what we have got before our friends come back said Thorndyke glancing at the twinkling lights Lay the case down on the grass by the fence it will serve for a table

I did so and Thorndyke taking a letter from his pocket opened it spread it out flat on the case securing it with a couple of heavy stones although the night was quite calm Then he tipped the contents of the seed envelope out on the paper and carefully spreading out the pieces of glass looked at them for some moments in silence And as he looked there stole over his face a very curious expression with sudden eagerness he began picking out the large fragments and laying them on two visitingcards which he had taken from his cardcase Rapidly and with wonderful deftness he fitted the pieces together and as the reconstituted lenses began gradually to take shape on their cards I looked on with growing excitement for something in my colleagues manner told me that we were on the verge of a discovery

At length the two ovals of glass lay on their respective cards complete save for one or two small gaps and the little heap that remained consisted of fragments so minute as to render further reconstruction impossible Then Thorndyke leaned back and laughed softly

This is certainly an unlookedfor result said he

What is I asked

Dont you see my dear fellow Theres too much glass We have almost completely built up the broken lenses and the fragments that are left over are considerably more than are required to fill up the gaps

I looked at the little heap of small fragments and saw at once that it was as he had said There was a surplus of small pieces

This is very extraordinary I said What do you think can be the explanation

The fragments will probably tell us he replied if we ask them intelligently

He lifted the paper and the two cards carefully onto the ground and opening the case took out the little microscope to which he fitted the lowestpower objective and eyepiecehaving a combined magnification of only ten diameters Then he transferred the minute fragments of glass to a slide and having arranged the lantern as a microscopelamp commenced his examination

Hal he exclaimed presently The plot thickens There is too much glass and yet too little that is to say there are only one or two fragments here that belong to the spectacles not nearly enough to complete the building up of the lenses The remainder consists of a soft uneven moulded glass easily distinguished from the clear hard optical glass These foreign fragments are all curved as if they had formed part of a cylinder and are I should say portions of a wineglass or tumbler He moved the slide once or twice and then continued We are in luck Jervis Here is a fragment with two little diverging lines etched on it evidently the points of an eightrayed starand here is another with three pointsthe ends of three rays This enables us to reconstruct the vessel perfectly It was a clear thin glassprobably a tumblerdecorated with scattered stars I dare say you know the pattern Sometimes there is an ornamented band in addition but generally the stars form the only decoration Have a look at the specimen

I had just applied my eye to the microscope when the stationmaster and the inspector came up Our appearance seated on the ground with the microscope between us was too much for the police officers gravity and he laughed long and joyously

You must excuse me gentlemen he said apologetically but really you know to an old hand like myself it does look a littlewellyou understandI dare say a microscope is a very interesting and amusing thing but it doesnt get you much forrader in a case like this does it

Perhaps not replied Thorndyke By the way where did you find the hat after all

We havent found it the inspector replied

Then we must help you to continue the search said Thorndyke If you will wait a few moments we will come with you He poured a few drops of xylol balsam on the cards to fix the reconstituted lenses to their supports and then packing them and the microscope in the case announced that he was ready to start

Is there any village or hamlet near he asked the stationmaster

None nearer than Corfield That is about halfamile from here

And where is the nearest road

There is a halfmade road that runs past a house about three hundred yards from here It belonged to a building estate that was never built There is a footpath from it to the station

Are there any other houses near

No That is the only house for halfamile round and there is no other road near here

Then the probability is that Brodski approached the rail way from that direction as he was found on that side of the permanent way

The inspector agreeing with this view we all set off slowly towards the house piloted by the stationmaster and searching the ground as we went The waste land over which we passed was covered with patches of docks and nettles through each of which the inspector kicked his way searching with feet and lantern for the missing hat A walk of three hundred yards brought us to a low wall enclosing a garden beyond which we could see a small house and here we halted while the inspector waded into a large bed of nettles beside the wall and kicked vigorously Suddenly there came a clinking sound mingled with objurgations and the inspector hopped out holding one foot and soliloquizing profanely

I wonder what sort of a fool put a thing like that into a bed of nettles he exclaimed stroking the injured foot Thorndyke picked the object up and held it in the light of the lantern displaying a piece of threequarter inch rolled iron bar about a foot long It doesnt seem to have been here very long he observed examining it closely there is hardly any rust on it

It has been there long enough for me growled the inspector and Id like to bang it on the head of the blighter that put it there

Callously indifferent to the inspectors sufferings Thorndyke continued calmly to examine the bar At length resting his lantern on the wall he produced his pocketlens with which he resumed his investigation a proceeding that so exasperated the inspector that that afflicted official limped off in dudgeon followed by the stationmaster and we heard him presently rapping at the front door of the house

Give me a slide Jervis with a drop of Farrant on it said Thorndyke There are some fibres sticking to this bar

I prepared the slide and having handed it to him together with a coverglass a pair of forceps and a needle set up the microscope on the wall

Im sorry for the inspector Thorndyke remarked with his eye applied to the little instrument but that was a lucky kick for us Just take a look at the specimen

I did so and having moved the slide about until I had seen the whole of the object I gave my opinion Red wool fibres blue cotton fibres and some yellow vegetable fibres that look like jute

Yes said Thorndyke the same combination of fibres as that which we found on the dead mans teeth and probably from the same source This bar has probably been wiped on that very curtain or rug with which poor Brodski was stifled We will place it on the wall for future reference and meanwhile by hook or by crook we must get into that house This is much too plain a hint to be disregarded

Hastily repacking the case we hurried to the front of the house where we found the two officials looking rather vaguely up the unmade road

Theres a light in the house said the inspector but theres no one at home I have knocked a dozen times and got no answer And I dont see what we are hanging about here for at all The hat is probably close to where the body was found and we shall find it in the morning

Thorndyke made no reply but entering the garden stepped up the path and having knocked gently at the door stooped and listened attentively at the keyhole

I tell you theres no one in the house sir said the inspector irritably and as Thorndyke continued to listen he walked away muttering angrily As soon as he was gone Thorndyke flashed his lantern over the door the threshold the path and the small flowerbeds and from one of the latter I presently saw him stoop and pick something up

Here is a highly instructive object Jervis he said coming out to the gate and displaying a cigarette of which only halfaninch had been smoked

How instructive I asked What do you learn from it

Many things he replied It has been lit and thrown away unsmoked that indicates a sudden change of purpose It was thrown away at the entrance to the house almost certainly by some one entering it That person was probably a stranger or he would have taken it in with him But he had not expected to enter the house or he would not have lit it These are the general suggestions now as to the particular ones The paper of the cigarette is of the kind known as the ZigZag brand the very conspicuous watermark is quite easy to see Now Brodskis cigarette book was a ZigZag bookso called from the way in which the papers pull out But let us see what the tobacco is like With a pin from his coat he hooked out from the unburned end a wisp of dark dirty brown tobacco which he held out for my inspection

Finecut Latakia I pronounced without hesitation

Very well said Thorndyke Here is a cigarette made of an unusual tobacco similar to that in Brodskis pouch and wrapped in an unusual paper similar to those in Brodskis cigarette book With due regard to the fourth rule of the syllogism I suggest that this cigarette was made by Oscar Brodski But nevertheless we will look for corroborative detail

What is that I asked

You may have noticed that Brodskis matchbox contained round wooden vestaswhich are also rather unusual As he must have lighted the cigarette within a few steps of the gate we ought to be able to find the match with which he lighted it Let us try up the road in the direction from which he would probably have approached

We walked very slowly up the road searching the ground with the lantern and we had hardly gone a dozen paces when I espied a match lying on the rough path and eagerly picked it up It was a round wooden vesta

Thorndyke examined it with interest and having deposited it with the cigarette in his collectingbox turned to retrace his steps There is now Jervis no reasonable doubt that Brodski was murdered in that house We have succeeded in connecting that house with the crime and now we have got to force an entrance and join up the other clues We walked quickly back to the rear of the premises where we found the inspector conversing disconsolately with the stationmaster

I think sir said the former we had better go back now in fact I dont see what we came here for buthere I say sir you mustnt do that For Thorndyke without a word of warning had sprung up lightly and thrown one of his long legs over the wall

I cant allow you to enter private premises sir continued the inspector but Thorndyke quietly dropped down on the inside and turned to face the officer over the wall

Now listen to me inspector said he I have good reasons for believing that the dead man Brodski has been in this house in fact I am prepared to swear an information to that effect But time is precious we must follow the scent while it is hot And I am not proposing to break into the house offhand I merely wish to examine the dustbin

The dustbin gasped the inspector Well you really are a most extraordinary gentleman What do you expect to find in the dustbin

I am looking for a broken tumbler or wineglass It is a thin glass vessel decorated with a pattern of small eight pointed stars It may be in the dustbin or it may be inside the house

The inspector hesitated but Thorndykes confident manner had evidently impressed him

We can soon see what is in the dustbin he said though what in creation a broken tumbler has to do with the case is more than I can understand However here goes He sprang up onto the wall and as he dropped down into the garden the stationmaster and I followed

Thorndyke lingered a few moments by the gate examining the ground while the two officials hurried up the path Finding nothing of interest however he walked towards the house looking keenly about him as he went but we were hardly halfway up the path when we heard the voice of the inspector calling excitedly

Here you are sir this way he sang out and as we hurried forward we suddenly came on the two officials standing over a small rubbishheap and looking the picture of astonishment The glare of their lanterns illuminated the heap and showed us the scattered fragments of a thin glass starpattern tumbler

I cant imagine how you guessed it was here sir said the inspector with a newborn respect in his tone nor what youre going to do with it now you have found it

It is merely another link in the chain of evidence said Thorndyke taking a pair of forceps from the case and stooping over the heap Perhaps we shall find something else He picked up several small fragments of glass looked at them closely and dropped them again Suddenly his eye caught a small splinter at the base of the heap Seizing it with the forceps he held it close to his eye in the strong lamplight and taking out his lens examined it with minute attention Yes he said at length this is what I was looking for Let me have those two cards Jervis

I produced the two visitingcards with the reconstructed lenses stuck to them and laying them on the lid of the case threw the light of the lantern on them Thorndyke looked at them intently for some time and from them to the fragment that he held Then turning to the inspector he said You saw me pick up this splinter of glass

Yes sir replied the officer

And you saw where we found these spectacleglasses and know whose they were

Yes sir They are the dead mans spectacles and you found them where the body had been

Very well said Thorndyke now observe and as the two officials craned forward with parted lips he laid the little splinter in a gap in one of the lenses and then gave it a gentle push forward when it occupied the gap perfectly joining edge to edge with the adjacent fragments and rendering that portion of the lens complete

My God exclaimed the inspector How on earth did you know

I must explain that later said Thorndyke Meanwhile we had better have a look inside the house I expect to find there a cigaretteor possibly a cigarwhich has been trodden on some wholemeal biscuits possibly a wooden vesta and perhaps even the missing hat

At the mention of the hat the inspector stepped eagerly to the back door but finding it bolted he tried the window This also was securely fastened and on Thorndykes advice we went round to the front door

This door is locked too said the inspector Im afraid we shall have to break in Its a nuisance though

Have a look at the window suggested Thorndyke

The officer did so struggling vainly to undo the patent catch with his pocketknife

Its no go he said coming back to the door We shall have to He broke off with an astonished stare for the door stood open and Thorndyke was putting something in his pocket

Your friend doesnt waste much timeeven in picking a lock he remarked to me as we followed Thorndyke into the house but his reflections were soon merged in a new surprise Thorndyke had preceded us into a small sittingroom dimly lighted by a hanging lamp turned down low

As we entered he turned up the light and glanced about the room A whiskybottle was on the table with a siphon a tumbler and a biscuitbox Pointing to the latter Thorndyke said to the inspector See what is in that box

The inspector raised the lid and peeped in the station master peered over his shoulder and then both stared at Thorndyke

How in the name of goodness did you know that there were wholemeal biscuits in the house sir exclaimed the stationmaster

Youd be disappointed if I told you replied Thorndyke But look at this He pointed to the hearth where lay a flattened halfsmoked cigarette and a round wooden vesta The inspector gazed at these objects in silent wonder while as to the stationmaster he continued to stare at Thorndyke with what I can only describe as superstitious awe

You have the dead mans property with you I believe said my colleague

Yes replied the inspector I put the things in my pocket for safety

Then said Thorndyke picking up the flattened cigarette let us have a look at his tobaccopouch

As the officer produced and opened the pouch Thorndyke neatly cut open the cigarette with his sharp pocketknife Now said he what kind of tobacco is in the pouch

The inspector took out a pinch looked at it and smelt it distastefully Its one of those stinking tobaccos he said that they put in mixturesLatakia I think

And what is this asked Thorndyke pointing to the open cigarette

Same stuff undoubtedly replied the inspector

And now let us see his cigarette papers said Thorndyke

The little book or rather packetfor it consisted of separated paperswas produced from the officers pocket and a sample paper abstracted Thorndyke laid the half burnt paper beside it and the inspector having examined the two held them up to the light

There isnt much chance of mistaking that ZigZag watermark he said This cigarette was made by the deceased there cant be the shadow of a doubt

One more point said Thorndyke laying the burnt wooden vesta on the table You have his matchbox

The inspector brought forth the little silver casket opened it and compared the wooden vestas that it contained with the burnt end Then he shut the box with a snap

Youve proved it up to the hilt said he If we could only find the hat we should have a complete case

Im not sure that we havent found the hat said Thorndyke You notice that something besides coal has been burned in the grate

The inspector ran eagerly to the fireplace and began with feverish hands to pick out the remains of the extinct fire The cinders are still warm he said and they are certainly not all coal cinders There has been wood burned here on top of the coal and these little black lumps are neither coal nor wood They may quite possibly be the remains of a burnt hat but lord who can tell You can put together the pieces of broken spectacleglasses but you cant build up a hat out of a few cinders He held out a handful of little black spongy cinders and looked ruefully at Thorndyke who took them from him and laid them out on a sheet of paper

We cant reconstitute the hat certainly my friend agreed but we may be able to ascertain the origin of these remains They may not be cinders of a hat after all He lit a wax match and taking up one of the charred fragments applied the flame to it The cindery mass fused at once with a crackling seething sound emitting a dense smoke and instantly the air became charged with a pungent resinous odour mingled with the smell of burning animal matter

Smells like varnish the stationmaster remarked

Yes Shellac said Thorndyke so the first test gives a positive result The next test will take more time

He opened the green case and took from it a little flask fitted for Marshs arsenic test with a safety funnel and escape tube a small folding tripod a spirit lamp and a disc of asbestos to serve as a sandbath Dropping into the flask several of the cindery masses selected after careful inspection he filled it up with alcohol and placed it on the disc which he rested on the tripod Then he lighted the spirit lamp underneath and sat down to wait for the alcohol to boil

There is one little point that we may as well settle he said presently as the bubbles began to rise in the flask Give me a slide with a drop of Farrant on it Jervis

I prepared the slide while Thorndyke with a pair of forceps picked out a tiny wisp from the tablecloth I fancy we have seen this fabric before he remarked as he laid the little pinch of fluff in the mounting fluid and slipped the slide onto the stage of the microscope Yes he continued looking into the eyepiece here are our old acquaintances the red wool fibres the blue cotton and the yellow jute We must label this at once or we may confuse it with the other specimens

Have you any idea how the deceased met his death the inspector asked

Yes replied Thorndyke I take it that the murderer enticed him into this room and gave him some refreshments The murderer sat in the chair in which you are sitting Brodski sat in that small armchair Then I imagine the murderer attacked him with that iron bar that you found among the nettles failed to kill him at the first stroke struggled with him and finally suffocated him with the tablecloth By the way there is just one more point You recognize this piece of string He took from his collectingbox the little end of twine that had been picked up by the line The inspector nodded Look behind you you will see where it came from

The officer turned sharply and his eye lighted on a string box on the mantelpiece He lifted it down and Thorndyke drew out from it a length of white twine with one green strand which he compared with the piece in his hand The green strand in it makes the identification fairly certain he said Of course the string was used to secure the umbrella and handbag He could not have carried them in his hand encumbered as he was with the corpse But I expect our other specimen is ready now He lifted the flask off the tripod and giving it a vigorous shake examined the contents through his lens The alcohol had now become darkbrown in colour and was noticeably thicker and more syrupy in consistence

I think we have enough here for a rough test said he selecting a pipette and a slide from the case He dipped the former into the flask and having sucked up a few drops of the alcohol from the bottom held the pipette over the slide on which he allowed the contained fluid to drop

Laying a coverglass on the little pool of alcohol he put the slide on the microscope stage and examined it attentively while we watched him in expectant silence

At length he looked up and addressing the inspector asked Do you know what felt hats are made of

I cant say that I do sir replied the officer

Well the better quality hats are made of rabbits and hares woolthe soft underfur you knowcemented together with shellac Now there is very little doubt that these cinders contain shellac and with the microscope I find a number of small hairs of a rabbit I have therefore little hesitation in saying that these cinders are the remains of a hard felt hat and as the hairs do not appear to be dyed I should say it was a grey hat

At this moment our conclave was interrupted by hurried footsteps on the garden path and as we turned with one accord an elderly woman burst into the room

She stood for a moment in mute astonishment and then looking from one to the other demanded Who are you and what are you doing here

The inspector rose I am a police officer madam said he I cant give you any further information just now but if you will excuse me asking who are you

I am Mr Hicklers housekeeper she replied

And Mr Hickler are you expecting him home shortly

No I am not was the curt reply Mr Hickler is away from home just now He left this evening by the boat train

For Amsterdam asked Thorndyke

I believe so though I dont see what business it is of yours the housekeeper answered

I thought he might perhaps be a diamond broker or merchant said Thorndyke A good many of them travel by that train

So he is said the woman at least he has something to do with diamonds

Ah Well we must be going Jervis said Thorndyke we have finished here and we have to find an hotel or inn Can I have a word with you inspector

The officer now entirely humble and reverent followed us out into the garden to receive Thorndykes parting advice

You had better take possession of the house at once and get rid of the housekeeper Nothing must be removed Preserve those cinders and see that the rubbishheap is not disturbed and above all dont have the room swept An officer will be sent to relieve you

With a friendly goodnight we went on our way guided by the stationmaster and here our connection with the case came to an end Hickler whose Christian name turned out to be Silas was it is true arrested as he stepped ashore from the steamer and a packet of diamonds subsequently identified as the property of Oscar Brodski found upon his person But he was never brought to trial for on the return voyage he contrived to elude his guards for an instant as the ship was approaching the English coast and it was not until three days later when a handcuffed body was cast up on the lonely shore by Orfordness that the authorities knew the fate of Silas Hickler

An appropriate and dramatic end to a singular and yet typical case said Thorndyke as he put down the newspaper I hope it has enlarged your knowledge Jervis and enabled you to form one or two useful corollaries

I prefer to hear you sing the medicolegal doxology I answered turning upon him like the proverbial worm and grinning derisively which the worm does not

I know you do he retorted with mock gravity and I lament your lack of mental initiative However the points that this case illustrates are these First the danger of delay the vital importance of instant action before that frail and fleeting thing that we call a clue has time to evaporate A delay of a few hours would have left us with hardly a single datum Second the necessity of pursuing the most trivial clue to an absolute finish as illustrated by the spectacles Third the urgent need of a trained scientist to aid the police and last he concluded with a smile we learn never to go abroad without the invaluable green case
